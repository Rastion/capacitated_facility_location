  "description": "The capacitated facility location problem involves selecting a subset of potential facilities to open and assigning each site to an open facility so as to minimize the total cost. The cost for a facility is defined as the sum of a fixed opening cost and the allocation costs for serving the sites assigned to it, while each facility's capacity must not be exceeded by the total demand of the sites it serves.",
